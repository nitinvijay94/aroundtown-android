##What is AroundTown?
Current event platforms do not offer a fast, crowdsourced, and a more streamlined method of hosting event pages. In fact, many events and gatherings in our daily lives don't require a comprehensive event hosting platform like Facebook or Evenbrite. We developed Around Town in order to mitigate this problem. Around Town allows users to anonymously host events, get basic information such as location and date of events, vote on events, read and write comments that reflects the audience's feeling about the event, and review relevant photos, all on a user-friendly mobile application. The event's credibility is determined by the audience through the vote system. This makes information distribution much faster due to the lack of need for central authority to manage events. With Around Town, anyone can host events ranging from small giveaways on college campuses to large-scaled conventions like HackGT where information about food and tech talks need to be distributed quickly and easily. The application is currently developed only on Android.
